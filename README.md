Prototypes of new features for Fatiando a Terra 
===============================================

These IPython notebooks contain the with early prototypes of various things that made it (or not) into [Fatiando a Terra](http://fatiando.org).

* [An implementation of the inversion framework using functions](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/fatiando/prototypes/blob/master/inversion_refactor_function_implementation.ipynb)
* [An object oriented implementation of the inversion framework](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/fatiando/prototypes/blob/master/inversion_refactor_oo_implementation.ipynb) (the final version was based on this)
* [Classes to run the finite-difference wave equation simulations](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/fatiando/prototypes/blob/master/wavefd-simulation-class.ipynb)
* [A first draft of a class for 3D linear potential field inversion](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/fatiando/prototypes/blob/master/blocky-inversion.ipynb)
